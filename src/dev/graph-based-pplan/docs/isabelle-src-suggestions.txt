* Unifiers from unification should be cross-instantiated.

You sometimes get things of the form ["X = f Y", "Y = g"], it would be
better to have this as: ["X = f g", "Y = g"]. See my code in
term_manip.ML for this.


* Move unification outside the kernel.

Unification should be taken outside the kernel, there is no need for
it to be there and it doesn't really speed things up. See my version
of resolution for an idea how to do this.


* Isar show statements should allow hypothesis

showing "A ==> B" in Isar doesn't work, you need to "assume A" and
"show B", this is not very intuitive and could fairly easily be
fixed. We need to change "rtac" to "bicompose" in exporting of shown
results.


* Freezing and thawing of type variables

There should be better functions for these - ones where you specify
the type vars/freese that you want to manipulate -- see my code
term_manip.ML.


* Clean up in Term.ML

make Term.term_frees and Term.term_vars give the contents of Free and
Var, rather than terms. Ie. like Term.term_tfrees.
