TODO SOON

- Create flex-flex containt managing code

- Separate contraint code from main proof code. 


NICE/LOW PRIORITY

- Make fresh names support numerical postfixes, which are inremented
and decremented appropriately. "pred a0 = a_1" and "pred a_1 = a_2"
etc and "suc a2 = a3" and "suc a9 = a10", etc.

- Add Thm object justification records to method applications to allow
easy re-consturction of Isabelle Thm object.

- Change basic subst tactic so that redundent flexflex pairs are not
created.

- Separate inherited asms and fixed params from those made
locally. 


BIG/FAR-AWAY

- Create a notion of neested scopes to allow renaming of scoped things
efficiently. Proper proof manipulation! Then add notion of local
result within a scope - allowing forward proof as expected.


SMALL/IRRELEVENT:

- manage dependencies between fixes vars and assumption in order to
optimise use of names for fixed things.


DONE 

- When a variable is instantiated to another variable, making it no
more specific, then re-use the old name -- lucas 24 Jan. 06.
