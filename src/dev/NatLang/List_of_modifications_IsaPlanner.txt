modified src/rtechn/rippling/basic_rtechn.ML (multiple fertilisations + other suff maybe)

modified src/cinfos/htrace/htrace_cinfo.ML (added Tree and Trace constructor to signature, and created get functions)

added rstate_names.ML (global source of names for reasoning state names)

added rippling-interface.ML (my versions of all the techniques I modified; refined base in induct_ripple_multfert_lemcalc so that it has children in the htrace)

modified src/rtechn/conj/conj_rtechn.ML (all lemmas were called lem_a!! That's a bug, so now I call them "lem_{<g>}" where <g> stands for the name of the goal it is being applied to. This completely removes the problem of duplication.

modified src/pplan/aprf.ML (added methkind, optmeth, meth, nd and T types to the signature so I can access)

modified src/pplan/aprf.ML (added function get_ndname_meth)

Using TermAnalysis structrue from term_analysis.ML once.
