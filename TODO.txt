This is a list of important things to be done:

1. rewrite InstEnv, and Prf to fit remaing signature so that they
can be renamed and composed.

2. rewrite Isabelle tactic integration: use composable prf, fix
meta-varaiables in this process if they occur in assumptions. Allow
tactic integration to be given list of assumptions.

3. Fix double-lifting in prf; fix double lifting in subst.

4. Provide full Isar interfaces.

5. Fix tactic language to use statically named goals.

6. Write fully composable zipper-based rewriting/update rippling
appropriately.

7. Rewrite planning tactics and graphical integration.

8. Write parser for tactic language.
